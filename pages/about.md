## About My College Buddies
My College Buddies is a personal space where I share moments, memories, and milestones with the amazing people I’ve met in college. These photos are snapshots of laughter, late-night studies, spontaneous adventures, and everything in between — the real and raw college life we live together.

This site is a small tribute to the friendships that make college unforgettable. Thanks for stopping by and being part of our story!
